# Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects

# Setup Service

  ## Process

    * Install Project Dependencies
    * Generate the Project Key
    * Run the Migrations

  Please navigate to `/service/` and run the following commands:

  ```
  composer install
  php artisan key:generate
  php artisan migrate
  ```

  Setup a MySQL Database for the project for example:

  ```
  CREATE DATABASE ldm_test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
  GRANT ALL on ldm_test.* to ldm_test@127.0.0.1 identified by 'ldm_test';
  ```

# Start the Service:

  Please navigate to `/service/` and run the following command:

  ```
  php artisan serve

  ```

  Expected Results:
